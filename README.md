# Facial-Expression-Recognition
Detects the face expression and labels it with the suitable expression name using DeepFace Library


# Overview

The real-time facial emotion recognition project utilizes Python along with OpenCV and DeepFace libraries to detect and analyze emotions in live webcam feeds. It employs a face cascade classifier to detect faces in each frame captured from the webcam. Once faces are detected, the DeepFace library is utilized to analyze the emotions present in the detected faces. 


Used:
1.Python: Programming language used for development.
2.OpenCV (cv2): Library for computer vision tasks such as image and video processing.
3.DeepFace: Library for facial analysis, including emotion detection.
